- 👋 Hi, I’m Vinnícius
- 👀 I am interested in developing fun and interesting projects as I develop myself more and more as a Front End Developer.
- 🌱 I'm strongly deepening my knowledge in Front End languages and frameworks like HTML5, /CSS3/JavaScript VueJS and ReactJS.
- 💞️ I am willing to collaborate with anyone who is interested in obtaining my services as a professional.
- 📫 If you are interested and want to contact me, talk to me in direct on instagram: @vinas_prado or visit my profile on Linkedin Vinnícius Yuri
